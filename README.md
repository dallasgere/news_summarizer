# news_summarizer

- attempting to build a news summarizer from kaggle CNN article dataset

# my method to all this

- Okay so I was going to preprocess my data and then use BART to train a model, but apparently BART has a version thats pre trained on CNN-Daily mail dataset so thats silly of me
  - I think i'll just go through with the experiment anyways and deploy the model. Either way I still learned stuff

# dataset

- I obtained the data from this dataset
